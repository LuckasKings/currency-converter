# Currency Converter
This is a currency converter project written in Python, developed as a requirement for the completion of the "Match" institution's programmer training course.

# Project Description
The aim of this project is to provide a simple and efficient tool for converting monetary values between different currencies. Two versions of the currency converter were developed, each using a different graphical library:

TkInter Version: This version uses the TkInter library to create a user-friendly and intuitive graphical interface. With it, users can enter the value to be converted, select the source and target currencies, and obtain the converted value with just a few clicks.

Dash Version: The second version of the currency converter uses the Dash library, which allows for the creation of interactive web interfaces. With this version, users can access the currency converter through a web browser, making it easily accessible and usable on different devices.
